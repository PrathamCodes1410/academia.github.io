# About Me

Hi, I’m **Pratham Thakkar**, an undergraduate researcher in Computer Science and Engineering at VIT Bhopal (expected graduation: 2026).  
I work at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Explainable AI (XAI), and Quantum Computing**, where I’m fascinated by the question of *why models make the decisions they do* and *how we can make them better by understanding their inner reasoning*.  

I’ve published and presented research on areas like **brain tumor classification**, **Vision Transformers vs. CNNs for medical imaging**, and **concept-level causal inference in deep learning**. My work is driven by curiosity: I like to look beyond correlation and search for explanations that matter.

## Research Interests

- **Explainable AI (XAI):** bridging interpretability and performance by combining techniques like LRP, Integrated Gradients, and causal inference.  
- **Neural Architectures & Training Paradigms:** exploring new ways of structuring and training models for robustness and generalization.  
- **Quantum Machine Learning (QML):** leveraging quantum principles to rethink what learning systems could look like.  
- **Healthcare AI:** applying ML to domains like medical imaging and diagnostics with a focus on trustworthy decision-making.  

I like to connect ideas across fields — for example, drawing inspiration from **genetics, evolution, and neuroscience** to imagine better approaches for AI.

## Beyond Research

When I’m not working on AI models or writing code, you’ll probably find me in one of these zones:

- **Sports Enthusiast:** Huge follower of **Formula 1, Football, Tennis, and Cricket**. (You’ll catch me passionately analyzing Arsenal’s midfield or the latest F1 strategy calls.)  
- **Curiosity-Driven Reading:** I enjoy books and articles on **genetics, evolution, brain science**, and the philosophy of intelligence — topics that often fuel fresh perspectives in my research.  
- **Conversations I Enjoy:** I love discussing how **new scientific theories** might shape AI, debating sports strategies, or exploring big “what if” questions about technology and human potential.
