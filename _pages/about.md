Iâ€™m **Pratham Thakkar**, a final-year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at VIT Bhopal University, with a specialization in **Health Informatics**. Most of my undergraduate reasearch work is at the intersection of machine learning and its applications acorss various domains. Beyond this, I am particularly interested in building explainable and trustworthy AI models to better understand their inner workings and decision-making processes. 

I enjoy connecting ideas across disciplines and fitting them into the realm of artificial intelligence â€” from **genetics and evolution** to **neuroscience and sports analytics**, finding parallels that help me think about intelligence and learning in new ways. Outside research, Iâ€™m a huge sports enthusiast, closely following **Formula 1, football, tennis, and cricket**, and I often find the strategy and performance dynamics in these games inspiring for how we think about systems and optimization.  

At the heart of my work is curiosity: whether itâ€™s in academia or sports, Iâ€™m drawn to understanding *why things work the way they do* and how that understanding can push us toward better solutions.

## Current Research Interests

- **Explainable AI (XAI):** bridging interpretability and performance by combining techniques like LRP, Integrated Gradients, and causal inference.  
- **Neural Architectures & Training Paradigms:** exploring new ways of structuring and training models for robustness and generalization.  
- **Healthcare AI:** applying ML to domains like medical imaging and diagnostics with a focus on trustworthy decision-making.
- **Applied ML:** using current generation of models to explore its uses cases for betterment of humanity across various domains

I like to connect ideas across fields â€” for example, drawing inspiration from **genetics, evolution, and neuroscience** to imagine better approaches for AI.

## Beyond Research

When Iâ€™m not working on AI models or writing code, youâ€™ll probably find me in one of these zones:

- Did I mention I love sports? with Arsenal occupying way too much of my weekends (and mood). I love dissecting football tactics or even the tiniest detail of an F1 pit strategy, or looking at F1 telemetry.

- Apart from that I love reading about other scientific fields like nuerosciece, evolution and astrophysics â€” ideas that spark connections with my research and keep me questioning how intelligence and universe really works.
Currently Reading - The Gene by Siddharta Mukherjee

-  Whether itâ€™s debating Arsenalâ€™s midfield balance, swapping thoughts on the latest F1 race, or exploring how new scientific theories might reshape AI, I enjoy conversations that mix passion with curiosity

Iâ€™m always open to discussing research, sports, or ideas that stretch the imagination.
